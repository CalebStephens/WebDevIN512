        Using JAVASCRIPT ONLY (i.e. do not write any CSS styles), do the following:

        1. Change the font-size of the container div to 60px;
        2. Select all the items, iterate through the array, and apply the corresponding
            colour from the colours array to the background (i.e. the first item should be
            blue, the second item should be hotpink, etc)
        3. While still iterating through the items, select the nested number span and change
            the 0 to be the appropriate number in the container (i.e. the first item's number
            should say 1, the second item's number should say 2, etc)

        */        
                
        
        //changing font size
        document.querySelector("#container").style.fontSize = "60px";
       //iterating through all divs called item
        let items = document.querySelectorAll(".item");
        let number = document.querySelectorAll(".number");
        for(let i = 0; i <= items.length; i++){
            items[i].style.color = colours[i];
            number[i].innerHTML = i+1;
        }

       
        /*
            So.... not bad. The first selector with the "#container" is perfect.

            The next parts are... mostly correct... but there are some areas to improve.

            First, you need to make sure you READ the question carefully... you have changed the TEXT
            COLOUR of the items, instead of the BACKGROUND COLOUR which was asked for... in the real SBA
            this would be marked wrong.

            Next... the 'newer' (read: more expected from devs) way to loop through those arrays is with
            the built-in forEach function... your querySelectorAlls are fine, but then doing stuff with
            the resulting things can be done like this:

                let items = document.querySelectorAll(".item");
                let number = document.querySelectorAll(".number");
                items.forEach((item,index) => {
                    item.style.backgroundColor = colours[index];
                    number[index].innerHTML = index+1;
                })

            Or, better still... instead of selecting a separate array of the numbers, we can use querySelector
            FROM the item, and grab its child span like this:

                let items = document.querySelectorAll(".item");
                items.forEach((item,index) => {
                    item.style.backgroundColor = colours[index];
                    item.querySelector(".number").innerHTML = index+1;
                })

            And finally... we don't really need to put the items into a variable, since we never refer
            to it again... so the most concise way would be:

                document.querySelectorAll(".item").forEach((item,index) => {
                    item.style.backgroundColor = colours[index];
                    item.querySelector(".number").innerHTML = index+1;
                })
                
        */
